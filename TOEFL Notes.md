**Example for Introduction：**

**Recently, a prevalent statement we hear is that** increasing number of colleges intend to fund many social activities in order to attract those elite students. **A considerable number of opponents, however, propose** the idea that this policy is more likely to result in the far more exodus of top students from colleges **since** increasing needs of good students cannot be met in terms of this new financial policy. **As far as I am concerned, the former view seems to align more with my perspective, and two reasons would suffice here to support my point of view.**



**Example for Supporting Paragraph：**

1. 举例

   **Specifically**, unlike today, students without the help of the Internet, TV programs and published books to get access to the knowledge which they are interested in. **In this regard**, students are essential to follow their teachers all the time to gain the important things they need to know so that we often can see students and teachers were discussing paper and conducting experiment together. **By doing so**, their students would gain the chances to improve their academic level rapidly. 

2. 引用

   **Moreover**, psychological **studies indicates that** shopping is a perfect outlet for people to unleash the pent-up negative feelings. **In a word**, giving pocket change to children is a win-win strategy, It not only boosts children's self-seteem and happiness but also builds a healthy relationship and mutual trust between parents and children.

3. 对比

   **On the contrary**, teacher at the present time seem not to be as important as counterparts before. **This is because** the rise of the Internet and TV programs would afford students far more valuable and interesting information for students **so that** what teachers know may be far less than their students in one field. **Moreover**, far more TV programs and published books can provide them with sufficient amount of knowledge which guarantee them to teach by themselves successfully. 

4. 让步

   **True**, **although** teachers at the present time seem to maintain the greater amount of knowledge and diverse teaching methods to pass on far more valuable things for their students, **it is not to say that** teachers in the modern society is far more influential than counterparts in the past. **On the contrary**, teachers in the past seem to be more influential for students **because** they were the major channels for students to gain knowledge in the past time. 

**As a result**, the role of teachers in the current time is no longer as essential as counterparts in the past. **Thus**, teachers in the past exert a more important effect than those today.



**Example for Counterargument Paragraph: **

1. Counterargument

   **Though** study abroad **offers many advantages**, **some may argue that** a semester or year abroad is nothing but a vacation. 

2. Refute

   **Adimttedly, it is true that** some students choose to treat studying abroad as a vacation rather than the rich academic experience that it can be. **However, we could find that those people wrong estimated the situation because**, the bad actions of a few students should not invalidate study abroad programs as whole or cause colleges to abandon their efforts in this regard. 

3. Suppport

   **In fact**, in a long-term study of 3,400 students, Dwyer and Peters (2004)found that a large number said studying abroad had an impact on their world view (96 percent), increased their self-confidence (96 percent), and gave them the skill sets they needed for the career they chose (76 percent). Clearly, studying abroad is not just a party. Students’ home institutions should offer preparatory workshops and orientation seminars so that students will be ready for the requirements of the program and will better understand how it connects with their current academic work. 

4. Conclusion

   **Therefore**, Studying abroad unites academic demands with the thrill of discovering a new culture, and students will gain immeasurably more from the experience if they are prepared prior to departure for what they will discover there. 

   

**Example for Couclusion: **

In conclusion, given the numerous benefits of studying abroad, colleges and universities should require that their students take advantage of this opportunity. 

Study abroad programs enable students to explore life in a new culture which raises their cross-culture awareness. Students’ language competence also increases rapidly while learning in a foreign language environment. Besides, learning their own major in another country will allow students to learn new knowledge, approaches and perspectives. 

Thus, in an increasingly interconnected world in which one’s cross-culture competence is highly valued, studying a semester abroad will be the answer to prepare students for the future challenges.

**Question:**

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?**The best way to truly relax and reduce stress is to spend time alone.**Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

**Answer:**

Nowadays, there is a prevalent statement we often hear is that the best way to truly relax and reduce stress is to spend time alone. As far as I am concerned, this idea is align with my perspective, and two reasons here would be suffice to support my point of view.

First of all, spending time alone allows us to get completely absorbed in our hobbies and preferences, thus enabling us to obtain the sense of relaxaion and relieving our burden in such a hustle and bustle world. Specifically, it is not uncommon for us to foster some interests in reading, enjoying movies or photography. In this regard, by spending our time alone, we gain more access to the fantastic world of our hobbies without the possible interruption from others. By doing so, we are capable to digging deeper in such areas, and naturally, harvest relaxation and satisfaction in such a process to balance our stress in work and life. On the contrary, people who prefer to spent time with others tend to not get truly relaxation in many cases. This is because the fact that people are all living in the society at most time and are under great pressure from others, which is called 'peer pressure' in social science. This means that people tend to do some things they don not appreciate under this pressure. They are eagerly to have their own time to do the things they really want and get mentally relaxtion to balance this pressure. 

Secondly, spending time alone can offer people a chance to reflect on themselves to gain a inner peace. When people are set alone, they get a opportunity to evaluate all the aspects of themselves, in which process they can not only recall the sweet memories in the past, but also learn lessons from past errors and pains. By doing so, they can get a sense of relaxation called 'inner peace', and the memories may also make preparations for their future life to reduce their pressure in forwarding. As indicated in a psychological research, subjects having a habit to spare some time to stay alone and make thoughts tend to have a robust mental health compared with others. In a word, spending time alone can generate relaxation and reduce the level of stress to some degree.

However, though spending time alone offers many merits discussed above, some may argue that this deed may result in fear of socializaion. Admittedly, excessive isolation from the social can do harm to perple's interaction ability. However, we could find that those people wrong estimated the situation because spending time alone is only a appendix to the normal social life but not the whole life. People gain both benefited from social life and alone time by spending some time alone to relax.

In conclusion, given the numerous benefits of spending time alone, it is highly recommended that we spend time alone to gain truly relax and reduce stress. (492 words)



**TPO56**

To begin with, the practice of continued recording helps maintain the relationship with distant friends. Specifically, because of geographical distance with some friends, we are gradually lack of opportunities to communicate with them directly. Clearly, when we upload the pictures about what we do in the daily life, such as participating in some indoor or outdoor activities, exercising in the gym, or presenting our talents in the field of art, it is highly possible that friends downloading the same social software may browse the completed information we record. No one can deny the possibility that they may write something about the feeling in the message board after they notice what we record about our latest life conditions, which means that we can establish a connection with those distant friends.

 

Secondly, uploading pictures to the social websites can preserve our precious memories, which offers an access for people to their unique memories even after a long time. As is indicated in a technology report, personal physicial storage like disks and memory sticks may be worn out and loss information they keep after a long using period. That's is to say, if we keep our past pictures or information in such media, it is possible for us to confront tremendous loss. On the contrary, with the help of the social websites and cloud disks, we can access our images and other information anytime and anywhere, without being fear of lossing information and other accidents happens to our data.
